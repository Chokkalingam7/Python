# Python
This Repository consists of two files in which one is aadhar where we can update aadhar details through aadhar number and other is hospital management system where I used to create database and tables for Doctors, Patients, Co- Workers in workbench through which Doctors have three parameters namely Name, Experience and Expertise in. Patients have also three parameters namely Name, Age, Treatment they went for. Co Workers have also three parameters namely Name, Qualification and position they are working. If we made changes In the python input values it automatically reflects change also in the database Table.
